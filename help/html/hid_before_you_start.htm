<P><A HREF="hid_creating_a_conference.htm">Creating a New CIX Forum</A></P>

<P>Think about what (and for whom) your forum will be for. There are no limits (other than CIX's terms and conditions and the law :-) upon you.</P>

<P>Will your forum be technical, personal, social, spiritual, political,...? Do you want it to be openly accessible to anyone on CIX (an <A HREF="hid_open_conferences.htm">open forum</A>) or do you want entry to be restricted? If so, do you want details about it to be freely available so people can ask you for entry (a <A HREF="hid_closed_conferences.htm">closed forum</A>) or should it's existence be revealed only to those people you choose to invite in (a <A HREF="hid_cc_conferences.htm">closed confidential forum</A>)?</P>

<P>If you are planning an open or, in most cases, a closed forum, you need to check whether there is already a forum on CIX that you would end up duplicating. Check the <A HREF="hid_check_conf_list.htm">CIX forum list</A> and look at the <A HREF="hid_check_conf_description.htm">forum description</A> for any forums that look to cover similar subjects.</P>

<P>You may find that an existing general forum has a topic that deals with the specific subject of your idea. Even if this is not the case, it may be more appropriate to arrange for the creation of a new topic in an existing forum (you could volunteer to co-moderate the forum) than to create an entire new forum.</P>

<P>Having got this far, you should post a message on CIX in the <I>conference/suggestions</I> topic and possibly in the <I>noticeboard</I> forum to see what interest and ideas you can get from other people on CIX.</P>
