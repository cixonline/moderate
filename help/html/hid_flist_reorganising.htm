<P><A NAME="hid_flist_reorganising"></A><B>Formatting a File List</B></P>

<P>You can insert descriptive <A HREF="hid_insert_flist_comment.htm">comment</A> lines and <A HREF="hid_insert_flist_blank_line.htm">blank lines</A> anywhere in your file list to clarify its layout. If the file list is more than a screen or so long, it may be worth subdividing it into sections to make it easier for your participants to find files.</P>

<P>You can move lines, or marked blocks of lines, up and down your file list using the <B><I>Move up</I></B> and <B><I>Move down</I></B> buttons.</P>

<P>You can sort file entries in the file list by highlighting the block (or blocks) of files you want to sort and selecting <A HREF="hid_flist_sort_file_list.htm"><B><I>Sort flist</I></B></A>. Moderate will sort each contiguous block of marked lines independantly. Indented continuations of file descriptions are kept with the relevant entry, embedded comment lines are kept with the following file entry (any comment lines at the top or bottom of the marked block are just left where they are).</P>
