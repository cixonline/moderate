<P>Selected from the <I>Topic...</I> button in the <A HREF="hid_flist_group_1.htm">file list dialog</A>.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/topicsel.jpg" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>This command allows you to change the topic whose file list you are editing without leaving the file list editor. All topics in forums you moderate are shown; if you choose a topic not marked in Ameol as having a file list, Moderate will display another <A HREF="hid_flist_query.htm">dialog</A> asking you what you want to do.</P>

<P>If you have made any changes in your previous topic's file list that affect the integrity of the existing file list on CIX (that is, if you have deleted or renamed any files), your old file list will be marked to be uploaded to CIX on your next blink. If you have made any other changes, you will be asked if you want to update the old topic's file list before Moderate switches to the new topic.</P>
