<P><A NAME="hid_flist_group_2"></A><B>The File List Editor Display</B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/close.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>on the <A HREF="hid_edit_flist.htm">main file list dialog</A></P>

<P>The file list editor display is intended to appear as close as is practical to the file list display as shown by Ameol to forum users. There are, however three details that differ:</P>

<P><B>1. Entry Type Indication</B></P>

<P>An extra column is displayed at the left of the list showing what the type or origin of the entry on that line is. The following characters may be displayed:</P>

<P>#A hidden memo line. The line will not be included in the users' file list and is purely for information to moderators. Memo lines are also displayed in grey.</P>

<P>cNormal file list files.</P>

<P>fFiles imported from the filepool.</P>

<P>uFiles added by upload in this edit session - they will become 'c' lines after the file and moderator's file list have been uploaded.</P>

<P>mFiles added from your binmail directory in this edit session - they will become 'c' lines after the file has been exported and the moderator's file list uploaded.</P>

<P>nFiles added by entering their names from notification messages received by you. They will become 'c' lines after you have refreshed your copy of the file directory and uploaded the moderator's file list.</P>

<P>hComment lines that have been held (that is, temporarily hidden).</P>

<P>Visible comment lines and indented comments are displayed with a blank space in the first column position.</P>

<P><B>2. Lines Invisible on the Users' File List</B></P>

<P>Memo lines and file list lines that have been held to hide them from users are displayed. They are displayed in grey to distinguish them from visible lines.</P>

<P><B>3. Missing File Sizes</B></P>

<P>In some situations, Moderate cannot determine the size of a file in the file list. It then displays a '?' character in place of the size in its display. This happens for:</P>

<P>All filepool file entries.</P>

<P>Files that have been added in an earlier editor session if you haven't blinked in between times - Moderate does not know in this case where the files have been added from, thus it cannot check that location for their sizes.</P>

<P>Files that are actually missing from the toic file directory. <B>Note</B> that such files will <B>not</B> be included in the users' file list when CIX creates it from the moderator's list and file directory.</P>
