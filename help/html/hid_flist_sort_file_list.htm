<P>Selected from the <I>Sort flist</I> button in the <A HREF="hid_flist_group_1.htm">file list dialog</A>.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/sortflst.jpg" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>This command allows you to sort the selected lines of your file list. If you have selected more than one region of the list (using control+left mouse button), each selected area will be sorted independently.</P>

<P>Only file entries are sorted. Thus, indented comment lines are kept with their preceding file entry and non-indented comments are kept with their following file entry. Any comment lines at the top of each selected area and any unindented comment lines at the end are not included in the sort.</P>
