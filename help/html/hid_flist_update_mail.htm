<P><A NAME="hid_flist_update_mail"></A><B>Updating Entries from Your Binmail Directory</B></P>

<P>Selected from the <A HREF="hid_flist_update.htm"><I>Update</I></A> button menu in the <A HREF="hid_flist_group_1.htm">file list dialog</A>.</P>

<P>Selecting <I>Mail dir</I> from the <I>Update</I> menu with one or more files selected in the file list will tell Moderate to search for files with the same names in your binmail directory. If a file is found with the same name as one you have selected, the old file in the CIX topic will be deleted and the new one exported from your mail directory to the topic.</P>

<P>If you don't currently have a copy of your binmail directory available offline, Moderate will offer to download it on your next blink.</P>

<P>Until you leave the file list editor (or change topics) your updated entries will be flagged by a <I>'m'</I> in the leftmost column of the file list display.</P>
