<P>What topics you choose for your forum when you first create it depends of course on what your forum is for, but there are some general points that are worth considering:</P>

<P><B>Don't Go Overboard :-)</B></P>

<P>Until your forum is established, there is no real way of knowing how much interest and activity is likely in a topic. Whilst it's tempting to create topics for every possible subject you can think of, it's usually better to start off with as few as you can; you can always create more topics later if the need arises.</P>

<P>Often just a <I>general</I> topic and one for files (if appropriate) is enough to start with. You may also want a <I>chatter</I> topic to provide a space for wibble and keep your other topics focussed on the subject in hand. In some cases, a read-only <I>announcements</I> or <I>digest</I> topic is also appropriate if your forum is likely to be very busy or if you are, for example, providing a support forum for a company.</P>

<P><B>Files, Files Everywhere</B></P>

<P>If people are going to download files from your forum, you need to decide where they are going to live. It's often better to have a single <I>files</I> topic as this prevents potential confusion about which of your file lists your participants should use. Consider making topics with files read-only so that notification messages you post about files don't get swamped in discussion.</P>
