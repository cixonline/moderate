<B>Note</B> that nearly every command in the file list editor can operate on more than one file (or other line) at a time; just use shift- or control-click to select the lines you want to deal with.<BR>

Most of the functions in this group are also available from a pop-up menu if you right-click your mouse on the file list. Note that the right mouse button is treated in the same way as the left for selecting files; if you want to apply a command to more than one file at a time, you'll need to use shift- or control-right click in order not to lose selections you have made with the left mouse button or keyboard first.</P>
