<P>This dialog shows you all the orphan files in the file directory of your current topic. You can select as many of these as you like; click on the <I>Append</I> button to add them to the end of your file list. When you have done so, the description editor will be started allowing you to add descriptions to each of the new entries.</P>

<P>File directory entries are flagged by a <I>'c'</I> in the leftmost column of the file list display.</P>

<P>Click on <I>Cancel</I> if you change your mind about appending files. The <I>Sort</I> button allows you to resort the list by name, file size or file date to make choosing files easier.</P>
