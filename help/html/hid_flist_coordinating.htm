<P>If your forum has more than one moderator, it is essential to coordinate updates to file lists to prevent changes by one moderator being overwritten by those of another who hasn't updated his or her copies of the the moderator's file list and file directory in the mean time.</P>

<P>The simplest way to avoid problems is to have a rota, though mistakes can still happen. An alternative worth considering if you have a lot of file list maintenance work in your forum is to create a closed confidential forum with a topic in it for protecting file list updates.</P>
