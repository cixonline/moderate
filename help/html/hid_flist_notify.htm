<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000">

<P><A NAME="hid_flist_notify"></A><B>Creating Notification Messages for File List Entries</B></P>

<P>Selected from the <A HREF="hid_flist_actions.htm"><I>Action</I></A> button menu in the <A HREF="hid_flist_group_1.htm">file list dialog</A>.</P>

<P>Moderate will automatically generate messages announcing new files in a file list for you when you select the <B><I>Notify</I></B> button.</P>

<P>If you have more than one file selected, Moderate will <A HREF="hid_flist_notify_select.htm"><B>ask you</B></A> if you want to create a single message for all of them or separate messages for each.</P>

<P>Each file description is preceded by lines of the form:</P>

<P><B>Filename: winhb03.exe<BR>
  File size: 238 968 bytes<BR>
Contributor: horus<BR>
       Date: Monday 22 August 1994</B></P>

<P>Note that Moderate cannot always fill in all of these fields. It doesn't know the size or date of filepool files or of files that have been added by upload or from your mail directory if you have left the file list editor and not blinked (to refresh your copy of the file directory) since adding them.</P>

<P>The <B><I>Contributor</I></B> field is set to your name for files you upload or that come from your mail directory, otherwise it is left blank for you to fill in.</P>

<P>The file description itself is set to whatever you have put into file list description for each file. It's generally worth expanding on this, particularly if you have a mailed notification describing the file.</P>

<P><B>Note</B> that this release of Moderate has no means of adding text from a mail message unless you have copied it to the clipboard before starting the file list editor. You can, of course, edit the notification messages from the Ameol outbasket, which would allow you to search your mail messages and copy and paste without closing down the Ameol message editor.</P>
