<P>Selected from the <A HREF="hid_flist_append.htm"><I>Append</I></A> button menu in the <A HREF="hid_flist_group_1.htm">file list dialog</A>.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/appmail.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>This dialog shows you all the files in your binmail directory. You can select as many of these as you like; click on the <I>Append</I> button to add them to the end of your file list. When you have done so, the description editor will be started allowing you to add descriptions to each of the new entries.</P>

<P>Until you leave the file list editor (or change topics) your new entries will be flagged by a <I>'m'</I> in the leftmost column of the file list display.</P>

<P>If you don't currently have a copy of your binmail directory available offline, Moderate will offer to download it on your next blink. You can also update your current copy using the <I>Update</I> button in this dialog or in Ameol's <I>Mail Directory</I> dialog.</P>

<P>Click on <I>Cancel</I> if you change your mind about appending files. The <I>Sort</I> button allows you to resort the list by name, file size or file date to make choosing files easier.</P>
