<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000">

<P><A NAME="hid_insert_flist_indented"></A><B>Inserting Indented Comments into a File List</B></P>

<P>Selected from the <A HREF="hid_flist_insert.htm"><I>Insert</I></A> button menu in the <A HREF="hid_flist_group_1.htm">file list dialog</A>.</P>

<P>Selecting <I>Indented</I> from the <I>Insert</I> menu inserts an indented comment line into your file list at the current cursor position. This line will be indented to start at the same point as that of file descriptions.</P>

<P>The description editor is then started allowing you to type in whatever text you like; this text can extend over more than one line, the indented comment in your file list being expanded as required when you leave the description editor.</P>

<P>Note that this command is not needed to enter file descriptions that extend over more than a single line; Moderate will add indented lines automatically if you type in a file description that is longer than one line.</P>
