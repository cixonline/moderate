<P>You can delete files from a file list by highlighting their entries and selecting <A HREF="hid_flist_delete.htm"><B><I>Delete</I></B></A> from the <B><I>Action</I></B> button popup menu. This will remove their entries from the file list and, depending on how you have Moderate configured, will also delete them from the file directory.</P>

<P>Entries can be temporarily hidden (if there is some doubt about whether a file is legal to post on CIX, for example) using <A HREF="hid_flist_hold.htm"><B><I>Hold</I></B></A> from the <B><I>Action</I></B> button popup menu. Held entries are greyed out in the file list editor display, and are invisible in the users' file list. To release a held file entry, just select <B><I>Hold</I></B> again.</P>

<P>You can update a file with a new version with the same name from your binmail directory using <A HREF="hid_flist_update_mail.htm"><B><I>Update <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Mail dir</I></B></A> or from your local hard disc using <A HREF="hid_flist_update_upload.htm"><B><I>Update <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Upload</I></B></A>. In the latter case, the file on your hard disc needn't have the same name as that of the flist file being updated; Moderate will rename it for you after uploading it to CIX. If you update files, don't forget to edit the file list description if required, and post a notification message so your participants know that the file has changed.</P>
