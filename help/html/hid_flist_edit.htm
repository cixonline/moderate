<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000">

<P><A NAME="hid_flist_edit"></A><B>Editing Entries in a File List</B></P>

<P>Selected from the <I>Edit</I>  button in the <A HREF="hid_flist_group_1.htm">file list dialog</A> or by double-clicking on entries in the file list.</P>

<P>Selecting <I>Edit</I>  starts the Moderate description editor. If you have more than one entry in the file list selected, the <I>Next</I>  and <I>Previous</I>  buttons are enabled in the editor allowing you to step through the files you have selected. Click on the <I>Done all</I>  button when you have finished editing all the descriptions.</P>

<P><B>Note</B> that indented description lines following a file description and sequences of comment lines are treated as single entries for editing purposes; Moderate takes care of formatting these and adjusting the number of lines used automatically for you.</P>

<P>The appearance of description editor dialog varies according to whether you are editing a <A HREF="hid_flist_edit_fdir.htm">file entry</A>, a <A HREF="hid_flist_edit_filepool.htm">filepool file entry</A>, a <A HREF="hid_flist_edit_comment.htm">comment</A>, a <A HREF="hid_flist_edit_tabbed.htm">tabbed comment</A> or a <A HREF="hid_flist_edit_memo.htm">private memo</A>.</P>

<P>The following button group is always present:</P>

<P>The <I>Undo</I> button cancels changes you have made to the current entry you are editing; you cannot undo changes after switching away from an entry using <I>Next</I> or <I>Previous</I>.</P>

<P>In all cases the <I>Today's date</I> button inserts today's date into the description in the format defined in <A HREF="hid_settings.htm"><I><B>Settings <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Moderate</B></I></A>. When editing file entries, the <I>File date</I> button is enabled and inserts the modification date of the file whose description is being edited.</P>
