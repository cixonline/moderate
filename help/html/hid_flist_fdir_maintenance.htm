<P>Selecting the <A HREF="hid_flist_group_4.htm"><B><I>File Directory</I></B></A> tab in the file list editor allows you to view and manipulate the file directory for your topic. You can insert or append files into the file list from here, and rename, delete or download them regardless of whether they have entries in the file list or not.</P>

<P>If you are in any doubt whether a file someone has uploaded is legal (or virus-free if it is a program), you can download it from here and check it prior to adding it to the file list.</P>

<P>You can sort the file directory display by file name, size or date to make it easier to find the files you are interested in and you can use the radio buttons to control whether only <A HREF="hid_orphan_files.htm">orphan</A> files, file with entries in the flist or all files in the directory are displayed.</P>
