<P>Type in the name you have chosen for your new forum here. Forum names on CIX can be up to 14 characters long and can contain lower case letters, digits, plus and minus signs, underscores and full stops.</P>

<P>Certain names are not permitted by CIX, <I>news</I> and <I>mail</I> for example. The name you type in will be checked against these and for conflicts against the full CIX forum list (if you have a copy offline) as soon as you move to another field in the dialog. <B>Note</B> that Moderate cannot check against the names of existing closed confidential forums so conflicts may still occur when Ameol attempts to create the forum on CIX.</P>
