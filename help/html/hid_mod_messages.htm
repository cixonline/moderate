<P>As Moderator of your forum, you are free to withdraw messages which you feel are not relevant to a topic, and allow you to maintain a level of control over the forum proceedings. Occasionally people post messages twice (or more :-) in error; it is helpful if you withdraw all but one message in this case to save the confusion that can occur if people start commenting to more than one copy of the same message.</P>

<P>You withdraw messages while you are reading the forum normally, with the Ameol <B><I>Message <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Withdraw</I></B> command (or just by pressing the "<I>W</I>" key.</P>
