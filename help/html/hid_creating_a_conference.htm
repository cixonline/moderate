<P>Any user of CIX can create a new forum on any subject whenever they like, and forums created and run by its members are the lifeblood of CIX.</P>

<P>However, there is little point in creating a forum that no one else is interested in, one that duplicates an existing forum or one covering such a narrow subject area that discussion would soon fizzle out.</P>

<P><A HREF="hid_moderating_a_conference.htm">Moderating a forum</A> can be fun but isn't a responsibility to be taken lightly either; unless you take the time and effort required to keep it running smoothly, even a forum on a popular subject can wither and die. But if you get it right, your forum will bloom. :-)</P>
