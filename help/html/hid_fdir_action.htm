<P>{bmlwd ACTFDIR.SHG}Selecting the <I>Action</I> button displays a pop-up menu of actions that may be performed on the selected entries in the file directory.<BR>

Click on the menu entries displayed here for information on each option.<BR>

The functions in this menu are also available from the pop-up menu displayed if you right-click your mouse on the file directory. Note that the right mouse button is treated in the same way as the left for selecting files; if you want to apply a command to more than one file at a time, you'll need to use shift- or control-right click in order not to lose selections you have made with the left mouse button or keyboard first.</P>
