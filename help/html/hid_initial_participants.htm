<P>If there are people on CIX who have expressed an interest in joining your new forum, you can add them to the participants list using the <I><B>CIX Forums <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Participants</B></I> menu command (or by pressing <I>F4</I>) with your forum highlighted in Ameol's topic list or a message window open in one of its topics.</P>

<P>Don't start adding people wholesale; not everyone wants to be involuntarily thrust into a new forum. It's polite to mail anyone you do add telling them they've been joined, too.</P>
