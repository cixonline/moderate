<P>This dialog shows you all the files in your binmail directory. You can select as many of these as you like; click on the <I>Insert</I> button to add them to your file list. When you have done so, the description editor will be started allowing you to add descriptions to each of the new entries.</P>

<P>Until you leave the file list editor (or change topics) your new entries will be flagged by a <I>'m'</I> in the leftmost column of the file list display.</P>

<P>If you don't currently have a copy of your binmail directory available offline, Moderate will offer to download it on your next blink. You can also update your current copy using the <I>Update</I> button in this dialog or in Ameol's <I>Mail Directory</I> dialog.</P>

<P>Click on <I>Cancel</I> if you change your mind about inserting files. The <I>Sort</I> button allows you to resort the list by name, file size or file date to make choosing files easier.</P>
