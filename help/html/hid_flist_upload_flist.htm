<P>Selected from the <I>Upload flist</I> button in the <A HREF="hid_flist_group_1.htm">file list dialog</A>.</P>

<P>Use this button to upload and update the moderator's file list on CIX.</P>

<P>The file list will be updated automatically if you have made any changes to the file directory (renaming or erasing files) that would cause the existing CIX copy to become invalid. If you have made any other changes to the file list and haven't used this command, Moderate will ask you if you want to upload and update the list when you switch topics or exit the file list editor.</P>
