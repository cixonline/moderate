<P>This property sheet allows you to set various configuration options in Moderate to suit the way you want to work. For Ameol, these options are saved into your current Ameol initialisation file in a section called <I>[Moderate]</I>, for Ameol32 they are saved into the registry. (They can be edited by hand, but it is strongly recommended that you use this dialog to make any changes.)</P>

<P>Click on the controls in the property sheet for information on what they do.</P>
