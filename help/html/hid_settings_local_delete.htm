<P>Unless this checkbox is set, Moderate will not allow you to delete any topics in forums you moderate from your local messagebase; they will be recreated for you whenever you blink.</P>

<P>If you only take responsibility for some of the topics in a forum, the remainder being looked after by a co-moderator, you may want to set this checkbox to avoid your messagebase being cluttered with topics you have no interest in.</P>
