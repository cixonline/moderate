<P>{bmlwd RARROW.BMP}The file is an ASCII text file. Line termination may be LF or CR/LF.</P>

<P>{bmlwd RARROW.BMP}File names are always the first token in a line. They may be preceded by spaces or tabs.</P>

<P>{bmlwd RARROW.BMP}Filenames in the import file are only recognised if they are already in the file list. In other words, they must be inserted from the file directory first.</P>

<P>{bmlwd RARROW.BMP}Lines not starting with a filename held in the file list are ignored (unless they are recognised as a continuation of a file description - see below).</P>

<P>{bmlwd RARROW.BMP}Fields in each line are separated by spaces or tabs.</P>

<P>{bmlwd RARROW.BMP}The file description part of each line always starts the same number of tokens in.</P>

<P>{bmlwd RARROW.BMP}Lines following a successfully parsed file line that are indented more than that line are treated as continuations of that line's file description.</P>
