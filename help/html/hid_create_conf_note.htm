<P><A NAME="hid_create_conf_note"></A><B>Creating a CIX Forum Note</B></P>

<P>From the <I>Conf Note</I> button in the <B><I><A HREF="hid_create_conf.htm">CIX Forums <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Create Forum</A></I></B> dialog</P>

<P>Type the text of the forum note for your new forum into the editor. The text will be displayed by CIX after the list of topics when someone uses the CIX <B><I>show &lt;conf name&gt;</I></B> command or the Ameol <B><I>ShowConf</I></B> addon.</P>

<P>The text can usefully provide more information about your forum than a user can get from the one-line description or from the names and descriptions of the topics. If you have any special rules of conduct in your forum, put them here. Likewise, if your forum is closed, information on entry requirements here could save you dealing with pointless applications for membership.</P>

<P>{bmlwd RARROW.BMP}<B>Undo<BR>
</B>This button undoes <B>all</B> changes you have made to the text.</P>

<P>{bmlwd RARROW.BMP}<B>OK<BR>
</B>This will save any changes you have made and exit the editor. If you <B>have</B> made any changes, Moderate will mark the forum note for uploading to CIX if it has not already done so.</P>

<P>{bmlwd RARROW.BMP}<B>Cancel<BR>
</B>Cancel any changes you have made in this editing session and exit the editor. Note that this does <B>not</B> undo any changes you may have made earlier (or stop those changes being uploaded to CIX).</P>

<P>{bmlwd RARROW.BMP}<B>Help<BR>
</B>Displays this help screen.</P>
