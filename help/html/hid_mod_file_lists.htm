<P>If your forum has any topics with file lists, you will need to maintain those lists so that your participants can download files; files uploaded to a CIX forum topic are not made immediately available so that you, as moderator, can check them and ensure that they are relevant, don't breach copyright and (in the case of programs) aren't infected with a computer virus.</P>

<P>There are four lists you need to be aware of: the users' file list, the moderator's file list, the file directory and the filepool. If you are unsure about what any of these are, they are explained <A HREF="hid_flist_description.htm"><B>here</B></A>.</P>
