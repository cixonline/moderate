<P>It is quite likely that a new forum will need to be stirred up quite regularly in its early days if it is to germinate properly. To do this you should reply to as many messages as possible, and also start up as many conversations as you can manage yourself.</P>

<P>One lesson you quickly learn is that "beginners" are worth their weight in gold. Quite often they are nervous about speaking up for fear of sounding stupid before such "learned" company. Far from it! It is often these basic questions that gets a discussion going, and can often end up in greater enlightenment for those who thought their understanding was enough already.</P>

<P>It helps to be quite opinionated, as this encourages participants with opposing views to join in a discussion against you, however you should at all times try to be constructive in your comments. Attacking the favourite pastime or product of another participant does not always encourage discussion. It may only encourage that person to go elsewhere.</P>

<P>In the same vein, you should watch out for offensive or abusive message left by other participants. <A HREF="hid_mod_messages.htm">Remove</A> these messages immediately, and without comment. Making a comment (except perhaps, privately, by mail) simply draws attention to the offensive nature of the message. Abusive messages can often result from raging discussion, in which case the participant responsible is not particularly useful. On occasion however a forum such as CIX attracts what can only be described as a "nut", who will leave offensive messages at random in whatever forum comes to view.</P>

<P>If people can upload files to your forum, it is important that you check and add them to the <A HREF="hid_mod_file_lists.htm">file list</A> as promptly as possible; there are few things on CIX more frustrating that to know that a file you want has been uploaded but to be unable to get at it.</P>
