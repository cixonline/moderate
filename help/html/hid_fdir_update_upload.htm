<P><A NAME="hid_fdir_update_upload"></A><B>Updating Files by Uploading from Your Computer</B></P>

<P>Selected from the <A HREF="hid_fdir_update_popup.htm"><I>Update</I></A> button menu in the <A HREF="hid_flist_group_3.htm">file list dialog</A>.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/updupl.jpg" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>This dialog is a standard file selector. The initial directory is set to whatever you have your upload directory set to in Moderate's settings (this in turn defaults to your Ameol upload directory). The file selector is invoked for each filename you have selected in the file list.</P>

<P>When you have selected the file you want to use to update the file on CIX (it needn't have the same name as the CIX file), click on <I>OK.</I> The old file on CIX will be deleted and the file you have selected will be uploaded and, if necessary, renamed to match the old file on CIX.</P>

<P>Click on <I>Cancel</I> if you change your mind about updating any particular file.</P>
