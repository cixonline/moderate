<P>You can add new participants to your forum using the Ameol <B><I>CIX Forums <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Participants</I></B> command.</P>

<P>Be very careful who you add to a forum, some people don't like to be added by the Moderator, they prefer to join themselves or (in the case of a closed forum) to ask before being added.</P>

<P>Very rarely, it may be necessary for you to remove a participant; if someone is persistantly offensive or fails to observe whatever forum etiquette you have decided upon even after being you've sent hir warnings by email, then you can remove them from your forum, again by using the Ameol <B><I>CIX Forums <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Participants</I></B> command.</P>

<P><B>Note</B> that if your forum is open, there's nothing stopping the offender from immediately rejoining... If you have <I>serious</I> problems with someone on CIX, contact <I>support@cix.co.uk</I> by email.</P>
