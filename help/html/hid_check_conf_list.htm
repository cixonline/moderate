<P>The full CIX forum list is available from Ameol via the <I><B>CIX Forums <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Show All Forums<B></I> menu command. If you haven't already downloaded a copy, Ameol will mark it for download the first time you use this command. It's a good idea to get a fresh copy before creating a new forum as people add at least one new forum to CIX most days.</P>

<P>Look in the sections of the list relevant to the subject of your new forum and don't forget the list of new and unclassified forums at the bottom. It's probably worth searching for relevant keywords using the <I>Find</I> button as well.</P>
