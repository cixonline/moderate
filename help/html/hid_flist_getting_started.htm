<P>Before you can do anything with a file list using Moderate, you need to have a copy of the moderator's file list and the file directory on your machine. If you are sharing file list maintenance duties with co-moderators, you also need to make sure that the copies you have are up to date, otherwise you may end up trampling all over changes that someone else has made! See <A HREF="hid_flist_coordinating.htm">Coordinating File List Updates Between Co-moderators</A> for more on this.</P>

<P>If you have created a topic with a file list using Moderate, you will already have copies of the lists you require as Moderate downloads them automatically for you when the topic is created.</P>

<P>If you are starting work on an existing topic with a file list, you will see the following dialog when you select <B><I>CIX Forums <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> Edit File List</I></B>:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/dlflists.jpg" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>This is the same dialog as appears for updating the lists from CIX, but the moderator's file list and file directory checkboxes are preselected and disabled; you can't do anything unless these are downloaded, so there's not much point in allowing them to be unchecked. You can, though, choose not to download the users' file list if you wish.</P>
