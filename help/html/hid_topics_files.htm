<P>For existing topics, this check box is disabled as CIX does not provide moderators with the facility to remove a file list from a forum. You can add a file list to a topic created without one using the file list editor (<A HREF="hid_edit_flist.htm"><I><B>CIX Forums <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Edit File List</B></I></A>).</P>

<P>For new topics, select this check box if your new topic is to have a file list. Note that Moderate will set this box automatically for a topic called <I>files</I>.</P>
