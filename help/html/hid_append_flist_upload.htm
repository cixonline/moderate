<P><A NAME="hid_append_flist_upload"></A><B>Appending Entries by Uploading from Your Computer</B></P>

<P>Selected from the <A HREF="hid_flist_append.htm"><I>Append</I></A> button menu in the <A HREF="hid_flist_group_1.htm">file list dialog</A>.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/appupld.jpg" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>This dialog is a standard file selector. The initial directory is set to whatever you have your upload directory set to in Moderate's settings (this in turn defaults to your Ameol upload directory). The file selector allows multiple selections; when you have selected the files you want, click on <I>OK</I> and the description editor will be started allowing you to add descriptions to each of the new entries.</P>

<P>The files you select will be uploaded to the topic on your next blink.</P>

<P>Until you leave the file list editor (or change topics) your new entries will be flagged by a <I>'u'</I> in the leftmost column of the file list display.</P>

<P>Click on <I>Cancel</I> if you change your mind about appending files.</P>
