<P>If Moderate detects syntactic errors in a copy of the moderator's file list that it is reading in, it will display this dialog. You are offered a selection of options on what to do with the offending line - just select the radio button you want, any that can't be applied are greyed out.</P>

<P>Errors usually arise when a file list has been edited by hand. If Moderate reports a line as being invalid that looks OK to you, please binmail the offending .flm file from your Ameol flist directory to horus with a covering note in case there is a problem with Moderate's parsing algorithm. You can find out the name of the .flm file for your topic using the <I>Topicinf</I> addon available from the cix.support/files topic.</P>

<P>If the file list you are reading is obviously totally incorrect, use the <B><I>Abort</I></B> button to cancel the reading process.</P>
