<P>If your forum is busy or has many topics covering different subjects, you may want to share the workload of moderating it.</P>

<P>You can add (or remove) co-moderators with Ameol's <B><I>CIX Forums <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>Participants...</I></B> command; it's worth noting here that <B>all</B> co-moderators of a forum have exactly the same privileges, if you add someone as co-moderator, they can remove you... :-)</P>

<P>How you organise moderating responsibilities is up to you, but in general, it's better to either have a rota or to allocate responsibility for particular topics. If you're all trying to moderate the same topics at the same time, things either get left because you all assume someone else is dealing with it, or a question from a participant can end up with half a dozen identical replies.</P>

<P>The most important consideration is the updating of file lists; conflicts here can result in serious problems. See <A HREF="hid_flist_coordinating.htm">Coordinating File List Updates Between Co-moderators</A> for how to get round this.</P>
