<P><IMG SRC="../images/close.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0><B>Coordinating File List Updates Between Co-moderators</B></P>

<P>Whenever you want to make a change to the file list in, say, <B>my.conf/files</B>, you post a new message in the CC topic (let's call it <B>cc.conf/flists</B>) with title "Updating my.conf/files" and with the body of the message describing what you want to do - add fnord.zip, remove wibble.txt or whatever. You also update your copies of the mod's flist and fdir in the same blink.</P>

<P>If, after blinking, there are no un-commented messages (other than your own) in <B>cc.conf/flists</B> for <B>my.conf/files</B>, all is well and you go ahead with your changes and post a comment to your message saying "done" or whatever after you have updated the file list.</P>

<P>However, if someone else has posted an update message, you can either abandon your changes (if the other mod has announced that se is making the same changes as you plan) by commenting "abandoned" to your message, or you can wait until the other mod has posted their "done" comment, redownload the mod's flist and fdir and then make your changes and post your "done" comment. It's important <B>always</B> to post a comment, whether it be "done" or "abandoned", as otherwise the file list will remain "locked" for all other moderators.</P>

<P>It sounds complicated, but in practice it works very well; this is the method used for coordinating updates to all the Ameol forum file lists.</P>
