<P><A NAME="hid_mod_topics"></A><B>Looking After Topics in Your Forum</B></P>

<P><B>Topic size</B></P>

<P>There is a limit to the size of each topic on CIX; at present this is 2 megabytes, we are intending to increase or abolish this limit at some time in the near future. In the mean time, the Moderate <A HREF="hid_edit_topics.htm"><B><I>CIX Forums <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> Edit Topics</I></B></A> dialog displays the size of each topic in forums that you moderate.</P>

<P>Clearly, this information needs to be periodically updated from CIX. You can <A HREF="hid_topics_update.htm">configure</A> Moderate to update the topic size for each topic (or for all topics in a forum) either manually only, every <I>'n'</I> days or every time you blink.</P>

<P>You can also <A HREF="hid_topics_update.htm">configure</A> Moderate to warn you when a topic gets over a configurable percentage full.</P>

<P><B>Pruning forums</B></P>

<P>Withdrawn messages are not physically deleted by CIX so if you are running short of space in a topic, you may wish to physically remove the withdrawn messages in that topic. To do this select the <I>Prune</I> button from the <A HREF="hid_edit_topics.htm"><B><I>CIX Forums <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> Edit Topics</I></B></A> dialog. Pruning a topic on CIX can take a long time and the topic is temporarily made read-only while the topic is reorganised, so you should consider doing this at a non busy time, if possible.</P>

<P><B>Adding Topics</B></P>

<P>If there is a need for a new topic in your forum or if an existing topic is full, you can add new topics from the <A HREF="hid_edit_topics.htm"><B><I>CIX Forums <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> Edit Topics</I></B></A> dialog.</P>

<P>By convention, replacements for full topics have the same name prefixed with a digit. For example, <I>queries</I> would be supplanted by <I>2queries</I>, which in turn would be replaced by <I>3queries</I>, and so on.</P>

<P>All your participants should be automatically joined to any new topic you create, but occasionally this can fail to happen. Thus it is best to announce the existance of a new topic elsewhere in your forum to make sure that everyone knows about it.</P>

<P><B>Removing Topics</B></P>

<P>It is possible to delete topics from a forum, from the <A HREF="hid_edit_topics.htm"><B><I>CIX Forums <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> Edit Topics</I></B></A> dialog. This is usually only done if the topic is either full or obsolete and contains ephemeral data that it is unlikely that anyone will want to refer back to; unless you have asked <I>cixtech</I> to archive your topic first, it is impossible to recover a deleted topic.</P>
