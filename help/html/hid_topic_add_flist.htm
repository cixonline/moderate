<P>If you want to add a file list to an existing topic that was created without one, first of all make sure that Ameol hasn't the topic incorrectly marked as having a file list. If it has, remove the checkmark from the <B><I>Topic can have files</I></B>  flag in the <I>Settings</I> dialog for the topic, accessible from the Ameol forum list with your topic highlighted.</P>

<P>You then need to start the file list editor on the topic using the <A HREF="hid_edit_flist.htm"><B><I>CIX Forums <IMG SRC="../images/greenarr.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> Edit File List</I></B></A> command. You will be presented with the following dialog:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/flcreate.jpg" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>Make sure that the "Create file list" radio button is checked as shown and click on the <I>OK</I> button. This will take you into the file list editor with a blank file list. Do not insert any files at this stage, just put in any descriptive comment lines you wish and click on the <I>Upload flist</I> button.<BR>
<BR>
When you next blink, the file list will be created on CIX. Thereafter you can edit it in the normal way.</P>
