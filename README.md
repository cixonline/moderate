Moderate Source Code

This is the source code for the Moderate addon for Ameol. The main program 
is being released under the Apache license. The WinHorus library is released
under the CopyLeft license.

See the LICENSE file for more details.

For WinHorus, see the WINHORUS/COPYLEFT.TXT file for the license.

The code requires Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or greater to build. The
solutions file provided is for Visual Studio 2008 which is the minimum
supported version.


To Build
--------
Open mod32.sln in Visual Studio 2008 and do a full rebuild.

There should be NO warnings or errors. All projects have the warnings as
error flag set anyway.

To Run
------
Copy the generated modera32.adn to the Ameol addon folder and install from
within Ameol if required. Also copy the help file, moderate.chm, to the
same place.

Documentation
-------------
The source code is the only real documentation. Feel free to ask questions
in the ameol_dev forum though but CIX staff cannot guarantee much beyond
basic support.

Contributions
-------------
You are welcome to contribute changes back to the official Moderate source
tree. All changes will be reviewed before being accepted and it is assumed
that you've done your own, exhaustive, testing. Feel free to make private
binaries available for testing by other people.

Official Release
----------------
The open source code IS the main Moderate source now. All official builds
will use this, and any changes made by CIX staff will go into the open
source tree by default. We will make official builds available when we deem
that there are sufficient changes to warrant an upgrade.
